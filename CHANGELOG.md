  - Replace `turboMount.register(...)` with `registerComponent(turboMount, ...)`
  - Replace `turbo_mount_react_component` (or any other framework specific helper) with `turbo_mount`
  - Also see the new API for plugins and custom controllers in the README.

### Added

- Add a mount target to the base controller. ([@skryukov])
- Add `registerComponents` helper for vite. ([@skryukov])
